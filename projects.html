      <h3>Processing algorithms and seismic imaging with emphasis in carbonate
        reservoirs</h3>

      <p>Research and development of algorithms for processing and imaging of
      seismic data over carbonate reservoirs. The project aims for the synergetic
      association of (1) the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) method and (2) the
      application of modern signal processing techniques, common in medical
      imaging, radar, sonar and telecommunications. This project has as results
      the following technologies:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>2D/3D Common Reflection Surface (CRS) stacking software: Developed
        using high performance computing (HPC) techniques and able to process 2D
        and 3D seismic data up to Terabytes. A compatible interface with the
        ProMax® package was also developed, along with a manual, allowing its use
        in production level.</li>
        <li>2D/3D Normal Incidence Point (NIP) tomography software: Construction
        of velocity models for depth migration. Designed for parallel computing
        and with a ProMax® interface;</li>
        <li>2D/3D CRS Post-stack Time Migration: Final stages of development;</li>
        <li>Investigations of the latest techniques on time-to-depth conversion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Smart Compression of LWD Acoustic Data</h3>

      </table>

      <p>The project aims to develop algorithms/software for smart data
      compression of Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) acoustic data. The main focus
      is on developing a pattern recognition algorithm that can automatically
      detect structures on acoustic images away from the borehole. Downhole image
      interpretation based on the pattern recognition algorithm should enable the
      data transfer to the surface acquisition system in real time by mud pulse
      telemetry.</p>
